# Description

Repository dedicated to practice API development skills based on a <https://lynda.com> tutorial taught by Scott Moss.

## Breakdown

- **Node.js** (JavaScript) was the selected language used to design, build, and test this RESTful API
  - Main JavaScript libraries used for the completion of the project
    - express
    - body-parser
    - mongoose
    - jsonwebtoken

- **MongoDB** was the selected non-relational data base used to store the data
  - **Data Modeling** and **Querying** was achieved through the use of `mongoose` which helped to design the desired schema on top of mongo

- **JSON Web Token** or JWT was the selected third-party framework used to authenticate requests
  - This allowed to secure all the sensitive routes and provide an extra layer of security

- **Deployment** of this RESTful API is to be done through `heroku`
